**Description:** an animal social network. Groups were defined as individuals detected on the same nest-box during the same day, and co-memberships represented individuals that overlapped in nest-box exploration patterns during the same day. Networks were calculated from these group-by-individual matrices using the halfweight index. Each network represents social data collected for consecutive 6-day time window.

A node represents a physician and an edge between two physicians shows that the left physician told that the righ physician is his friend or that he turns to the right physician if he needs advice or is interested in a discussion. There always only exists one edge between two nodes even if more than one of the listed conditions are true.

**Description:** This is a network of interactions betweeen drugs, which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nodes represent drugs and edges represent drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions occur when the pharmacologic effect of a one drug is altered by the action of another drug, leading to unpredictable clinical effects such as adverse drug reactions. When several drugs are administered together, there might be a greater possibility of adverse drug reactions as one drug can increase or decrease the effect of another drug. It is thus crucial to identify drug-drug interactions, especially during drug development, when one needs to identify interactions between a new candidate drug and drugs that are already on the market. Drug-drug interactions are extracted from drug labels and scientific publications.  References: DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018. Wishart, David S., et al.

**Description:** This is a collection of protein-function association networks for a large number of human tissues. Nodes represent human proteins, tissues, and biological functions. Edges represent associations that indicate different biological roles of proteins in various tissues and cell types. The information on biological functions taking place in various tissues is determined based on manual curation and knowledge extracted from a tissue hierarchy. For example, 'low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling' is a biological function specific to blood plasma.  References: Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks.

**Description:** Protein-coding genes are DNA sequences that code for proteins. Each gene tells the cell how to put together the building blocks for one specific protein (there exist exceptions to this general principle, e.g., isoforms). The DNA sequences are first transcribed into mRNA. The corresponding mRNA molecules are then translated into polypeptide chains and these chains ultimately result in a protein, which is a working molecule in the cell.

**Description:** This is a disease-drug association network that contains information on drug-disease relationships. Nodes represent diseases and drugs (also including certain chemicals that are not human drugs), and edges represent associations between them. Examples of associations include interactions between arsenic and different diseases, including prostatic neoplasms, skin diseases, and myocardial ischemia. Disease-drug associations are useful to understand mechanisms by which drugs treat diseases and to develop hypotheses about mechanisms underlying environmental diseases. The information is extracted from a database of curated and inferred chemical-disease asssociations. Curated chemical-disease associations are extracted from published literature by biocurators. Inferred associations are established via curated chemical-gene interactions (e.g., chemical A is associated with disease B because chemical A has a curated interaction with gene C, and gene C has a curated association with disease B).

**Description:** This is a drug-target interaction network that contains information on which genes (i.e., proteins encoded by genes) are targeted by drugs that are on the U.S. market. Drug targets are molecules that play a critical role in the transport, delivery or activation of the drug. Drug target information is widely used to facilitate computational drug target discovery, drug design, drug docking or screening, drug metabolism prediction, drug interaction prediction, and general pharmaceutical research. Drug target information includes biotech drugs and nutraceuticals (these drugs on average have 5-10 unique target proteins), lists all targets that have been found to have physiological or pharmaceutical effects (not only a single primary target), and fully accounts for the fact that many drug targets are protein complexes composed of multiple subunits or combinations of proteins.

**Description:** This is a disease-gene association network that contains information on disease-associated genes. Nodes represent genes and diseases and edges represent associations between them. The information about genes and variants involved in human diseases can be used for different research purposes, including the investigation of molecular mechanisms of species diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypotheses on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes, and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.

**Description:** This is a chemical-gene interaction network that contains information on interactions between genes (i.e., proteins encoded by genes) and small molecules. Nodes represent chemicals and genes, and edges represent biological interactions between them. For example, small molecules can activate or inhibit proteins, such as enzymes or receptors, and can target proteins by binding to them with different binding affinities. For instance, aspirin has relatively low binding affinities, whereas rofecoxib is specifically binding protein PTGS2. The chemical-gene interaction network is global and as such considers interactions anywhere in an organism. The network aggregates high-throughput experiments data, manually curated datasets, and the results of several prediction methods into a single global network of chemical-gene interactions.

**Description:** This is a protein-protein association network that includes direct (physical) protein-protein interactions, as well as indirect (functional) associations between human proteins. Nodes represent proteins and edges represent associations between them. The information is based on direct physical binding of proteins and many other, indirect ways of cooperation and mutual regulation between proteins. For example, proteins can influence each other's production and half-life, exchange reaction products, participate in signal relay mechanisms, or jointly contribute toward specific biological functions. Together, these direct and indirect interactions constitute 'functional associations', a useful operational umbrella-term for specific and functionally productive protein-protein interactions of any type.

**Description:** This is a biological function network that classifies biological functions into a hierarchy. The hierarchy is specified by Gene Ontology that describes biological functions and relationships between them. Biological functions capture biological processes (i.e., pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products), cellular components (i.e., components/organelles where gene products are active), and molecular functions (i.e., molecular activities of gene products).  The information is extracted from Gene Ontology, which defines the universe of concepts relating to biological functions, and how these functions are related to each other.

**Description:** The data was collected from the music streaming service Deezer (November 2017). These datasets represent friendship networks of users from 3 European countries. Nodes represent the users and edges are the mutual friendships. We reindexed the nodes in order to achieve a certain level of anonimity. The edge files contain the edges - nodes are indexed from 0. The json files contain the genre preferences of users - each key is a user id, the genres loved are given as lists. Genre notations are consistent across users. In each dataset users could like 84 distinct genres. Liked genre lists were compiled based on the liked song lists. The countries included are Romania, Croatia and Hungary.

- **biology** blah
- **computer science** blah

## Instances for Exact Track

The instances are in `exact` folder. See [descripion of all instances](exact.md) (the same information can be found in the `exact.csv` file).
The distribution of categories is as follows.

| domain | number of instances |
| --- | --- |
biology             | 63 |

Nodes represent drugs and edges represent drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions occur when the pharmacologic effect of a one drug is altered by the action of another drug, leading to unpredictable clinical effects such as adverse drug reactions. When several drugs are administered together, there might be a greater possibility of adverse drug reactions as one drug can increase or decrease the effect of another drug. It is thus crucial to identify drug-drug interactions, especially during drug development, when one needs to identify interactions between a new candidate drug and drugs that are already on the market. Drug-drug interactions are extracted from drug labels and scientific publications.  References: DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018. Wishart, David S., et al.

The hierarchy is specified by Gene Ontology that describes biological functions and relationships between them. Biological functions capture biological processes (i.e., pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products), cellular components (i.e., components/organelles where gene products are active), and molecular functions (i.e., molecular activities of gene products).  The information is extracted from Gene Ontology, which defines the universe of concepts relating to biological functions, and how these functions are related to each other.

These datasets represent friendship networks of users from 3 European countries. Nodes represent the users and edges are the mutual friendships. We reindexed the nodes in order to achieve a certain level of anonimity. The edge files contain the edges - nodes are indexed from 0. The json files contain the genre preferences of users - each key is a user id, the genres loved are given as lists. Genre notations are consistent across users. In each dataset users could like 84 distinct genres. Liked genre lists were compiled based on the liked song lists. The countries included are Romania, Croatia and Hungary."
